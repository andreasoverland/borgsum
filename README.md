Super Simple Chess Engine

- What : Will currently do a depth 5 search on Kiwi Pete (without doing an extra level for checks on level 5 to test for mate)
- How to compile : make
- How to run : ./chessengine

to make diagrams for input
cat testbatch.txt|xargs -n 5  sh -c 'echo \"$1\" $2 $3 $4 $0'

	The fastest version is now in the branch bitboards, but the most versatile client is in master.
	Plan : merge the client-parts from master, into bitboards. then move set bitboards as master.

	The branch bitboards is now merged into master, including the nice client features from master.

	The master branch is ok now. But I would like the input arguments for the client to be easier to use, also to add a "log=true/false" option.
	Plan:
		- argument for board should be both board & turn & castling & en passant square
		  exmple : "r...k..r p.ppqpb. bn..pnp. ...PN... .p..P... ..N..Q.p PPPBBPPP R...K..R w KQk e3"
		- add argument names
		  - diagram
		  - fen
		  - maxlevel
		  - workunitid
		  - log = fen/diagram (if omitted, only statistics are logged at the end)
